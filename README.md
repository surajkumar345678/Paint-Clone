# Paint-Clone
The Paint Clone is created using canvas, each element to allow us to create a basic version of MS Paint.<br>
At the top, there is a toolbar with a series of font awesome icons if we hover over them, we have a title that comes up explaining what they do.<br>
So, there is a brush, background color, an eraser which clear the canvas. When we hover over eraser It turns red to indicate that it's a destructive action.<br>
There is a local storage, load from local storage, clear local storage and also save an image.<br>
On the left side of the toolbar there is a status showing brush, which is intended to show which tools is active, either the brush or the eraser and it also shows us some info when we click on one of these other buttons so far, to click save to local storage, it switches to a message that says canvas saved.<br>
I've also added a custom color input called JS Color to make sure that it looks the same regardless of browser or operating system. If we go into our background color and we click on any one color, it instantly changes the background of the canvas.<br>
On the left there is a brush and a slider. So the slider is allowing us to change the size of the brush upto 50px and can change the color as well.<br>
It is not responsive for devices which are smaller than 800px.
