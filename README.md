# Paint Clone

The Paint Clone is a web-based application that replicates the basic functionality of popular painting software like MS Paint. It provides users with a variety of tools and features to create digital artwork, drawings, and sketches directly within their web browser. From brush tools to color selection and saving options, this application offers a familiar and intuitive experience for users to unleash their creativity.

### Features

- **Brush Tools:** Use different brush sizes and shapes to create strokes of varying thickness and styles.
- **Color Selection:** Choose colors from a color palette or use the custom color input to select any color for your artwork.
- **Eraser:** Clear mistakes or unwanted portions of your artwork with the eraser tool. The eraser turns red when hovered over to indicate its function.
- **Local Storage:** Save your current canvas state to local storage, load from local storage, or clear local storage as needed.
- **Save Image:** Save your artwork as an image file for sharing or future reference.
- **Status Indicator:** The status indicator on the toolbar displays which tool is currently active (brush or eraser) and provides additional information when certain actions are performed.
- **Custom Color Input:** Utilizes the JS Color plugin for consistent color selection across different browsers and operating systems.
- **Background Color:** Change the background color of the canvas instantly by selecting a color from the palette.
- **Brush Size Slider:** Adjust the size of the brush stroke using a slider, with sizes ranging up to 50px.
- **Responsive Design:** While the application is not fully responsive for smaller devices, it offers a seamless experience on screens larger than 800px.
